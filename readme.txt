This mod will allow members with the appropriate permissions to ban members from either posting in individual topics or viewing them altogether. 

According to their permissions they can ban members and manage banned members from own topics only and/or any topic.
 
You can set the permissions for each membergroup in the Admin Panel-Permissions.

You can also select a board and/or boards where you do not want members to be banned from topics. You can do that at the Board Permissions in your Admin Panel.

The ban link can be found next to the other buttons of the topic, on top and on the bottom. It is added right after the Print button.

When you click the Ban From Topic button, a form appears to enter the username of the member(s) that you want to ban from that particular topic. The username field supports the auto suggest feature.

You can also send the banned member a pm informing them of the fact that they have been banned and why.

A new button called Manage Banned Members has been added to the moderators button, right after Link to Calendar button. Here you can see who banned who from that topic, and at what time.

An overall list of all banned members from topics has been added in the Admin Panel->Members->Topic Ban List. 

At the mod 's setting page, you can display a notice to members when they view the topics that they are not allowed to reply to, as well as deny them complete access to the topic.
